# Subscription-Based Content API

Description:
Develop a backend API for a premium content plaƍorm where users must have an active
subscription to access protected content. The system should enforce access control based on
user subscription status and support basic subscription management.

Technologies:
 Choose a backend framework (Node.js or Python)
 Database: PostgreSQL (recommended)

Tasks:
1. User Roles:
 Deƈne user roles: Free and Premium.
 Store and manage user subscription status.
2. Protected Content Access:
 Implement middleware that restricts access to premium content routes.
 Only users with an active Premium subscription should access protected
resources.
3. Subscription Upgrade:
 Provide an endpoint to upgrade a user from Free to Premium.
 Simulate a successful payment process.
4. Activity Logging:
 Log each instance of premium content access.
 Ensure logs capture relevant request details for analytics.
5. API Behavior:
 Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
 Validate request inputs.
 Handle common errors (unauthorized access, invalid requests, resource not
found).
6. Submission:
 Include a README with setup instructions.
 Provide steps to run the application locally.

 Include example API requests.
Optional Enhancements:
 Subscription expiration logic (e.g., Premium access expires aƌer 30 days)
 Generate monthly usage reports in CSV format
 Admin endpoint to view access logs
